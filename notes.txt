BUGS TO FIX:
1. Hover element in light mode on profile oddly colored
2. z-index of dark/light theme toggle popup in carousel
3. There should be no scroll bar in carousel or in the animation for lose/win
4. Negative percentile when you achieve a new highscore 
5. If you are logged in should not use cookies for highscore
6. Should eventurally fix having to refetch if a video is invalid, maybe fetch more videos at a time as a backup?
