BUGS TO FIX:
1. Hover element in light mode on profile oddly colored
2. Negative percentile when you achieve a new highscore 
3. If you are logged in should not use cookies for highscore
4. Should eventurally fix having to refetch if a video is invalid, maybe fetch more videos at a time as a backup?
