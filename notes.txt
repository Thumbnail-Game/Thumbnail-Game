"Great idea. Simple and fun. Digging the promo video.

Some thoughts:
✔️ - Put a transparent overlay/background behind the logo/play button on the homepage. Hard to read/accessibility isn't great.
✔️ - Why are the thumbnails interactive on the homepage? Can't click them. Maybe just a smaller scale size (way more subtle?)
❓ - The initial homepage load/flash/transition was really bad. The logo was practically full screen and one of the thumbnails was around 80% of the page. Consider using lazy loading and a null element (or loader).
❌ - I think the game options would look better vertically centered in their container (https://puu.sh/HVrRl/2e6957a4af.png)
✔️ - Why do you show score/highscore even when I'm not playing. Does it persist?
❌- Maybe it's because of my retina display but I feel like everything is too "big". Text, elements etc.
✔️- Consider a softer box shadow in these elements in light mode -- https://puu.sh/HVrSi/516181e2c4.png
- When I hit settings/trophy sometimes the whole header moves/shakes or individual icons. Changing between light/dark mode also triggers a really weird effect on the header.
✔️- The dark mode toggle moon icon goes blue when toggling but very briefly (weird flash)
✔️- What's the point in going back to a placeholder play page when clicking the logo in the top left? There's no content there. I feel like you should set a storage flag when they click play for the first time and skip the placeholder homepage with a redirect (it's not needed after first landing)
✔️- Think about some more left/right padding on the search results (https://puu.sh/HVrTL/ff64804965.png)
✔️- Why are the grey element bars different heights/sizes? Consistency is king. Also consider them starting from the same position instead of weirdly offset (https://puu.sh/HVrTL/ff64804965.png)
✔️- All of your text feels like headers (too much font weight). Consider dialling some of it back (https://puu.sh/HVrUG/126ccd8b8c.png) .
✔️- It's hard to distinguish between video title and number of views. Again, consider weights, colours and additional spacing (https://puu.sh/HVrVA/597c7023c8.png)
- The timer isn't clear enough, I didn't even notice it. Maybe make it bigger and red? Maybe it could pulse when it gets to 1/2 seconds
- I wouldn't use the youtube favicon. I bet it's copyrighted. I'd also put a disclaimer somewhere about all property belonging to youtube/copyright infringement.
✔️- Similar to above, all your box shadows feel too harsh (https://puu.sh/HVrVJ/b723de2c62.png) -- this website is awesome to find a perfect box shadow -- https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples (personally i love #11)
✔️- These buttons seem to be primary but don't follow the normal red/white colours. (https://puu.sh/HVrWs/1b76c3e935.png ) . Maybe "back" is secondary, but play again should be primary. Also consider making your secondary a white button with red outline and text for consistency with your primary button.
✔️- This icon desperately needs padding -- https://puu.sh/HVrXh/c100462e84.png
- I think the tick should be filled white for clarity -- https://puu.sh/HVrXz/dc18641acf.png
✔️ - A bunch of your promo videos seems to have a weird yellow overlay/filter. Doesn't really fit the aesthetic imo -- https://puu.sh/HVrZT/53d38aa84d.png

Anyway, just my two cents. See if any of this is helpful :)"

- As comment mentions above, should probably have a first time user 
flag to conditionally render the landing page
